Student name: An Coklar 


this assignment is not complete, and it will not compile. 
this code will not calculate the distance travelled from island to island. 
the biggest challenge in this assignment was getting std::optional to work. 
there are commented out portions in this code that are the remnants of trying to get std::optional to work
these comments were saved for tracking all the methods utilized to get it to work. 
i really wanted to get more out of this assignment as it would have been tremendous help for data structures,
but alas i did not have time due to family emergency. 
In addition, this code does not even begin to attempt the "Extra challenge" although it sounds fun
